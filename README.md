This is a legit cheating mod for gorilla tag, what it is, is when the grips(both) are held, there is a speed boost, not slight, but not overboard,
if any other button is held, or pressed during the double grips, it is disabled, if a single grip is held, it will not applied, there is also a bone esp that I had made myself, that is on all the time, it displays the head rig(a bit offset)
arms, fingers(and finger joints) elbows, shoulders, and spine, it's color is changed based on if someone is tagged, red = tagged, green = untagged, color will NOT change in rock monkey
